<hr>
<p>Rhesus stared at me the whole time.  He would open his mouth and then close it.  Kis wandered a round the perimeter of the clearing the farmhouse stood in.  He stomped out small fires as the embers drifted away from the fire.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; I asked aggravated at the constant staring contest from Rhesus.</p>
<p>He looked away with a slight reddening of the cheeks and then got up and joined Kis in walking the farmhouse.  He glanced back at me still, but at least it wasn't staring anymore.  I wondered what was his problem.</p>
<p>A large gust of wind swept through the trees and sparks flittered in the direction of the forest lining us.  Sparks fell in dried leaves and twigs and quickly ignited.</p>
<p>&quot;Shit!&quot; I hollered.</p>
<p>Where the fuck was Sasha?</p>
<p>Wait did he leave his pack?  On Aurora?</p>

<p>Sasha took his pack with him, and with it the Urn of Endless Water.  Shit!  I yelled in the direction Sasha had gone.  &quot;Sasha!  Fire!  We need you.&quot;</p>

<hr>
<p>I need you.  I sighed.  I needed him again.  I didn't have enough water on me to do any good.  I pulled out a blanket from my back pack and tried to smother the smaller fires and keep the flames from growing larger and spreading deeper into the forest.</p>
<p>Rhesus and Kis were doing their best to do the same thing.</p>

(1d20: [2] = 2)</p>
<hr>
<p>While the job was tedious, and it wasn't stopping the fire, we were at least keeping it from spreading deeper into the forest. Hopefully Sasha would arrive back soon.</p>
<p>I yelled again.</p>
<p>&quot;Sasha!&quot;</p>
<p>The sound of melodious laughter could be heard on the wind.  Someone was laughing at us.</p>
<p>Austin arrives in a hurry, and begins to help with containment.  Until Sasha arrives there was little more we could do.</p>
<p>In our panic Rhesus asked, &quot;You find an water out that way?&quot;</p>
<p>Austin shook his head.  &quot;Just a goblin barricade.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Damn.&quot; Rhesus pouted.</p>
<p>Sasha bursts through the brush with his back pack falling to the ground as he pulled out the Urn of Endless Water and points the opening at the fire in the brush.</p>

<hr>
<p>The fire dies quickly with the water dosing the flames.  We all sank to the ground in relief.  Sasha  sighed, &quot;Maybe our fire starter should carry it.&quot;  He said handing the urn to me.  &quot;Makes more sense I think.&quot;</p>
<p>I nodded.  It was my responsibility after all.</p>
<p>&quot;But we have bigger problems to worry about.&quot;  Sasha said.</p>
<p>&quot;Bigger than a house on fire.&quot; Rhesus asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, we are all going to die from this flesh eating disease if we don't bathe in the water of the magical pool guarded by a water sprite.&quot;  Sasha regaled us of his conversation with the girl of blue in the magical pool of water not too far from here.</p>
<p>When Sasha concluded Austin laughed, &quot;Well I know where these goblins live.  Should we get moving?&quot; He looked to Rhesus.</p>
<p>Rhesus looked at Sasha and me and then back to Austin, &quot;Are sure this isn't some sort of trick?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you want to take that risk?&quot; Sasha asked.  &quot;I sure don't.&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha collected his fallen back from the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;What about the fire?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Put it out.&quot; Austin said.  &quot;We can't risk it spreading.&quot;</p>
<p>I sighed and uncorked the urn and let loose a geyser of water at the farm house.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Put out the farmhouse fire (9)</em><br>
(1d20: [2] = 2)<br>

<ol>
<li><strong>L1 Best Tool:</strong> Provides an additional asset for any one task using a tool, even if that means exceeding the normal limit of two assets. (384)</li>
<li><strong>L5 Repel:</strong> One NPC within immediate range who is of a level lower than the cypher decides to leave, using their next five rounds to move away quickly. (396)</li>
<li><strong>L8 Poison (emotion):</strong> The victim feels Fear: Flees in terror for one minute when threatened. for one hour. (394)</li>
<li><strong>L6 Effort Enhancer (Noncombat):</strong> For the next hour, the user can apply one free level of Effort to a noncombat task without spending points from a Pool. The level of Effort provided by this cypher does not count toward the maximum amount of Effort a character can normally apply to one task. Once this free level of Effort is used, the effect of the cypher ends. (388)<br>

<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Second stream (9)</em><br>

<strong>Success</strong><br>
Developer: None<br>
(1d20: [7] = 7)</p>
<p>Depletion: 1d10: [1] = 1</p>
<hr>
<p>Most of the fire was out but a second stream was needed.  As it gushed the urn cracked and the water stopped.  But the fire was out.</p>
<p>Well shit!</p>
<p>&quot;Great.  Just fucking great!  You give the kid the urn and it breaks.  Just fucking great!&quot; Rhesus growled as he mounted his horse with Kis' help.  Willow still didn't like him much, but Sunny helped calm her disposition.  The pony was good that way, even with Kis handling the poor creatures so roughly.  Kobolds probably never really tended to horses much.</p>
<p>But I did feel the sting of the words. I had it all of a few moments and now it was broken -- probably unrepairable.  But I tucked it carefully into my bag and wrapped it in the slightly burnt blanket and thought maybe we could find someplace to repair it.</p>
<p>With the fire out, Austin lead the way to the goblin barricade.</p>
