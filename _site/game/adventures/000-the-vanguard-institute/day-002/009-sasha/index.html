<p>As we passed by the pile of dead bodies, or what we thought were dead, the larger goblin reaches up and tries to grab Nyx's ankle.  It groaned its last words, &quot;go'sht yeyish kasalligi.&quot; It's hand fell from Nyx's ankle, eyes wide and the words hanging in the air.</p>

<hr>
<p>The words had a meaning.  I'd heard it somewhere else before.  It was like recalling a memory.  &quot;Flesh eating disease&quot; I said.</p>
<p>Nyx looked at me with wide eyes and looked at the house in which the goblins had been attacking.  Small barrels were placed around the farmhouse.</p>
<p>Austin grabbed both of our elbows. &quot;We need to leave immediately.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And let someone else stumble upon it?&quot; Nyx asked.</p>
<p>He didn't hesitate as he pulled the fire around him and a ball of fire formed between his hands.  He tossed it at the farm house at one of the barrels and it exploded in a triumphant boom.  &quot;We should stay just incase it tries to catch the trees on fire.&quot;</p>
<p>Austin growled but nodded. Rhesus shouted, &quot;We need to go! I'm the leader I say we go! I'm not dying here.  I'm not going to breathe in this dying death any longer.  We move now!&quot;</p>
<p>Austin looked to me and then to Nyx, &quot;He's boss.&quot;  He said with a sigh.  &quot;I'm just here to watch your backs.&quot;</p>
<p>Nyx growled. &quot;If the forest burns down it's your fault,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, it's yours.  You could have just left it alone.  Like we should have done.&quot; Rhesus said.</p>
<p>&quot;Then fine.  I'll stay and watch.&quot;  Nyx said and sat down where he stood and watched the fire burn the house.</p>
<p>Rhesus laughed. &quot;Like I care. Let's go.&quot;  I stayed near Nyx and looked at Austin and pleaded with my eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Fine you two can stay here.  Let's go Austin, Kis.  On me, we move out.&quot;</p>
<p>Austin frowned. &quot;We shouldn't split the party Rhesus.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then make them come.&quot;  He said as he headed off in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Nyx snickered. &quot;You are going the wrong way.&quot;</p>
<p>Rhesus made a double back. &quot;I knew that.&quot;</p>
<p>Austin mounted his horse. &quot;I'm going to scout the area.  See if there are any other goblins lurking.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good idea.&quot; I said.  &quot;I'll go the other direction.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I said let's go.&quot; Rhesus shouted.</p>
<p>Kis groveled as he knelt before his so-called master. &quot;We stay.  We help.  Good things beat bad things.  Bad things there.&quot;  He pointed to the farmhouse on fire and waved his hand in front of his rust colored snout.  &quot;Go when fire kill all.  Bad.  Bad things hide.  Small.  Die.  Safe here, but cover holes.&quot;   He said as he wrapped a his cloak around his snout.</p>
<p>&quot;Good idea.&quot;  I said and pulled out a kerchief to tie around my nose and mouth.  Everyone else followed suit.</p>

<hr>
<p>I didn't take Aurora with me, I left her with Nyx to watch over.  Rhesus grumpily sat on the ground next to his horse, and Kis watched with fear in his eyes.  But it wasn't my problem.  I wasn't going to worry about the bratty prince.  Nyx could handle himself.</p>
<p>Scouting was my job.  And Austin was right.  We had to watch out for anything else that might attack us.</p>

<hr>
<p>And to the west there was nothing to be found.  I traveled a good distance when laughter caught my ears.  At first I thought I was hearing things.  I crouched down in the nearest bush and listened in the glittering sunlight from the canopy above.</p>
<p>The soft giggle of a girl splashing in water carried on the silence of the Glowing Forest.  I should leave her be.  Sirens and Water sprites were dangerous.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh please come out of the bushes and let me see you.&quot;  The melodious voice called out.</p>
<p>I sighed and stood up, stepping around the bush and trees I hid behind and took in the site of a small natural spring spilling into a clear pond with vibrant fish swimming in schools and a blue tinted girl sitting on a lily pad that was the size of a hippo.</p>

<p>She smiled. &quot;Aren't you tall.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not that tall.&quot; I said with a smirk. &quot;Average for my kind.&quot;</p>
<p>She cocked her head to the side.  &quot;Won't you come play with me?&quot;</p>
<p>I shook my head. &quot;I should get back to my friends.&quot;  I pointed in the general direction of where the farmhouse was. &quot;You know what happened at the farmhouse out that way?&quot;</p>
<p>The water sprite shook her head. &quot;The creatures say it is death to go there. The goblins want to destroy the place, I'm told.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, it's burning now.  Do you know what happened though?&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Does the water sprite know what happened at the farm house?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [7]+0 = 7)<br>
<strong>No</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>She giggled. &quot;It is not here.  I am not there, why would I know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Figured you might have heard something.  Thanks anyway.&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&quot;Come play with me?&quot;  She sang softly.</p>

Nimble, Fear, Disease<br>
(1d20: [13] = 13)</p>
<hr>
<p>The music washed over me and I took several steps closer to the pool of water.  &quot;Oh goodie,&quot; she giggled.</p>
<p>&quot;I really shouldn't stay,&quot; I said even as my feet moved closer, &quot;I really need to get back to my friend.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's going to die of the disease.&quot;</p>
<p>I blinked.  &quot;What?&quot;  All my movement stopped, &quot;Why do you say that?&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Is she telling the truth?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [17]+0 = 17)<br>
<strong>Yes</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Does she know a cure?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [11]+0 = 11)<br>
<strong>Yes, but</strong> Disguise, Daughter, Raid</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;All who go there die.  The fire burns, the smell carries I feel the death on the air.  But I can help.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;You do me a favor.  I do you a favor.  Simple.&quot;</p>
<p>I sighed. &quot;What do you need me to do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My daughter has been captured by the goblins.  Bring her back and I will let you and yours bathe in the cleansing water of my pond and heal all that ails you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How do I know you are telling the truth?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't.  Kill the man that captured her and I'll give you an extra bonus.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fine.&quot; I sighed.  &quot;How long till they die?&quot;</p>
<p>She shrugged. &quot;Could be dead already.&quot;</p>
<p>I growled and stormed away from the pond and when I was far enough away I bolted towards my friend.  I couldn't let Nyx die.</p>
