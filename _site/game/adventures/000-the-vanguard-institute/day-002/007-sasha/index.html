<hr>
<p>Giant fucking wasps! And here I am deathly allergic to them and I still stood up and fucking fought them. Needless to say I wasn't surprised we beat it.  Nor that Rhesus was the first to fucking go down, he was always careless.</p>
<p>But when Nyx woke us up for our watch I was still dead tired.  Nightmares plagued my dreams -- giant bees killing me before I could tell Nyx how I felt.  He needed something from me.  But I wasn't sure what I should do.  It's not like we'd have any alone time.  Didn't matter anyway as I sat down next to the dead fire with Kis the Kobold next to me.</p>
<p>It was quiet.  And boring.  I lit the small fire and kept warm in the chilly night air.  The trees outside gave off light, but I was a bit cold.  I was always cold when I was too far from Nyx.  He was perpetually warm.</p>
<p>I pulled out the slip of paper that took up residence in my pocket and I held it close to the flames, not close enough to burn, but close enough that the contents revealed themselves to me.</p>
<p>Kis watched from his side of the fire, but made no move to come closer.  I also pulled out my journal and pencil so I could write down what it said so I didn't need a fire to figure everything out.</p>
<p>I wasn't nearly as good at drawing as Nyx was, but I drew the symbols on the paper and studied them in the firelight.</p>
<p>It made no sense.  The symbols meant nothing to me, and the order even less so.  And I'm sure the placement was important.</p>

<hr>
<p>In the quiet of the night, the dead bug starting to smell sickening even Kis got annoyed and started digging a grave to hide the corpse.  He did rummage through the creatures chitten body to look for anything of use.  What could a giant wasp have?  Except maybe more of it's deadly poison on it.</p>
<p>I shouted a whisper at the rummaging Kobold, &quot;Why don't you harvest some of the venom?&quot;</p>
<p>Kis smiled.  &quot;Excellent.  Yes! Good for you?  Yes?&quot;</p>
<p>I nodded. &quot;Great for me, and even Rhesus.&quot;</p>
<p>Kis nodded and pulled out several vials from his pouch and began the process of carefully collecting the venom from the stinger.  He was struggling.  I sighed and got up, &quot;Here let me do it.&quot;</p>
<p>I'd never done it either, but I could do better than Kis I was certain.  He did give me a hand helping out with holding the dead corpse steady while I attempted to drain the stinger.</p>

<p>[!note] Artifact<br>
L6 Vial of Mind Disrupting Poison</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>We manage to get a vial full of the venom.  I didn't know how many uses it would have, but it was an excellent way to keep the mind disturbing poison on hand.  It had done a number on Rhesus, it could help in a fight.</p>
<p>Kis went back to digging the hole and I studied the note in my journal.  I had seen the writing before, The Obsidian Syndicate used it to hide messages in plain sight.  Of course anyone who intercepted them would know who it's from.  I hated puzzles.  But it was part of the thing.  Ever since I was little, someone from the Obsidian Syndicate had watched over me.  Helped me out of jams taught me all about the undercurrents that even a small town like Oceana had.  The Vanguard Institute wasn't the only organization recruiting in their self made village.</p>
<p>No, there were several organizations that pooled their resources into the Vanguard, and they didn't even know it.  The Vanguard that was.  I had pledged my loyalty to them when Nyx needed help.  Swore my life away to keep him safe.  Nyx didn't even know.  He never could know.</p>
<p>The sun peaked through the horizon, though the sky was covered in a thick layer of clouds that threatened to pour down rain upon us.  It was going to be a horrible day of travel.</p>
<p>But just as the others started to rouse I put the last piece of the puzzle together and had a fully deciphered message.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sasha, Ward of Saleh,</p>
<p>Heed this riddled call, dear friend,<br>
To Darkwell village, your steps must wend.<br>
Before the new moon's silent bloom,<br>
Find Avyne's presence in the gloom.</p>
<p>The Mockingbird</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tucked the journal back into my pouch and started making some breakfast.  I hoped we were on the road before the rain started to fall.</p>
