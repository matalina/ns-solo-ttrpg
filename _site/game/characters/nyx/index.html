<h1>Character Journal</h1>
<h2>Tier 1</h2>
<h3><strong>Descriptor:</strong> Empathic</h3>
<h5>EMPATHIC<a href="https://callmepartario.github.io/og-csrd/#descriptor-empathic" title="Permalink"></a></h5>
<p>Other people are open books to you. You may have a knack for reading a person's tells, those subtle movements that convey an individual's mood and disposition. Or you may receive information in a more direct way, feeling a person's emotions as if they were tangible things, sensations that lightly brush against your mind. Your gift for empathy helps you navigate social situations and control them to avoid misunderstandings and prevent useless conflicts from erupting.</p>
<p>The constant bombardment of emotions from those around you likely takes a toll. You might move with the prevailing mood, swinging from giddy happiness to bitter sorrow with little warning. Or you might close yourself off and remain inscrutable to others out of a sense of self-preservation or an unconscious fear that everyone else might learn how you truly feel. (44)</p>
<p>You gain the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open Mind:</strong> +4 to your Intellect Pool</li>
<li><strong>Skill:</strong> You're trained in tasks involving sensing other emotions, discerning dispositions, and getting a hunch about people around you.</li>
<li><strong>Skill:</strong> You're trained in all tasks involving social interaction, pleasant or otherwise.</li>
<li><strong>Inability:</strong> Being so receptive to others' thoughts and moods makes you vulnerable to anything that attacks your mind. Intellect defense rolls are hindered.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Type:</strong> Adept</h3>
<ul>
<li>Might 7 -&gt; 8</li>
<li>Speed 9 -&gt; 10</li>
<li>Intellect 12 -&gt; 16</li>
<li><s>6 points</s></li>
<li>Effort 1</li>
<li>Intellect Edge 1</li>
<li>Cyphers 3</li>
<li>Equipment: Appropriate clothing, plus two expensive items, two moderately priced items, and up to four inexpensive items of your choice.</li>
<li><strong>Weapons:</strong> You can use light weapons without penalty. You have an inability with medium weapons and heavy weapons; your attacks with medium and heavy weapons are hindered.</li>
<li><s>Scan</s></li>
<li><strong>Ward:</strong> You have a shield of energy around you at all times that helps deflect attacks. You gain +1 to Armor. Enabler. (196)</li>
<li><strong>Onslaught (1 Intellect point):</strong> You attack a foe using energies that assail either their physical form or their mind. In either case, you must be able to see your target. If the attack is physical, you emit a short-range ray of force that inflicts 4 points of damage. If the attack is mental, you focus your mental energy to blast the thought processes of another creature within short range. This mindslice inflicts 2 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor). Some creatures without minds (such as robots) might be immune to your mindslice. Action. (167)</li>
<li><strong>Hedge Magic (1 Intellect point):</strong> You can perform small tricks: temporarily change the color or basic appearance of a small object, cause small objects to float through the air, clean a small area, mend a broken object, prepare (but not create) food, and so on. You can't use Hedge Magic to harm another creature or object. Action. (149)</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Animal Handling</li>
<li>Drawing</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Changes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distinctive Physical Quirk:</strong> You have a unique physical aspect that is, well, bizarre. Depending on the setting, this can vary greatly. You might have purple hair or metal spikes on your head. Perhaps your hands don't connect to your arms, although they move as if they do. Maybe a third eye stares out from the side of your head, or superfluous tendrils grow from your back. Whatever it is, your quirk might be a mutation, a supernatural trait (a blessing or curse), a feature with no explanation, or just a really wild tattoo that draws a lot of attention.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Flavor:</strong> Magic</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blessing of the Gods:</strong> As a servant of the gods, you can call up blessings in their name. This blessing depends on the god's general demeanor and area of influence. Choose two of the abilities described below.
<ul>
<li><em>Fire (2 Intellect points).</em> You cause one creature or object within short range to catch fire, inflicting 1 point of ambient damage each round until the fire is extinguished (requiring an action). Action.</li>
<li><em>Health (3 Intellect points).</em> With a touch, you restore 1d6 points to one stat Pool of any creature, including yourself. This ability is a difficulty 2 Intellect task. Each time you attempt to heal the same creature, the task is hindered by an additional step. The difficulty returns to 2 after that creature rests for ten hours. Action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Focus:</strong> Bears a Halo of Fire</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shroud of Flame (1 Intellect point):</strong> At your command, your entire body becomes shrouded in flames that last up to ten minutes. The fire doesn't burn you, but it automatically inflicts 2 points of damage to anyone who tries to touch you or strike you with a melee attack. Flames from another source can still hurt you. While the shroud is active, you gain +2 Armor against damage from fire from another source. Enabler. (183)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Connection:</strong> You are always trying to impress that character with your skill, wit, appearance, or bravado. Perhaps they are a rival, perhaps you need their respect, or perhaps you're romantically interested in them. -&gt; Alex</p>
<h3>Power Shifts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Healing:</strong> One extra recovery roll per shift (each one action, all coming before other normal recovery rolls)</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Advancement</strong></h3>
<h4>Tier 2</h4>
