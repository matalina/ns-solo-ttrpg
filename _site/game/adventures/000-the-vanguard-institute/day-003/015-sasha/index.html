<strong>Yes, but</strong> Express, Storm, Fetid</p>
<hr>
<p>I slept in fits.  The ground was uncomfortable I was cold and my mind wouldn't shut off.  I thought about going after Nyx, but figured he was already asleep and he wouldn't wander far.  He never did.</p>
<p>When the sun rose by the forest lined pool I was sure I'd find Nyx sleeping in his bedroll or sitting by the fire making breakfast.  But he wasn't there.  Nothing of his was there.  He'd run away -- again.</p>
<p>I didn't bother waking the others, I searched the perimeter of the camp looking for signs.</p>

<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Looking for tracks (hindered) (15)</em><br>

<hr>
<p>But this wasn't my thing.  I truly sucked at scouting. I wasn't sure why I'd been assigned this task at all.   But I made a spiral away from camp until I heard Austin.</p>
<p>&quot;Sasha!&quot;</p>
<p>He didn't cry out Nyx's name, maybe he was back!</p>
<p>I rushed back to camp and my heart sank when my glowing friend was not present.</p>
<p>Austin waved me to sit down.  &quot;He's taken his horse and left.  Do you know where he'd go?&quot;</p>
<p>I shook my head. &quot;He doesn't usually go far.  But I can't find his trail.&quot;</p>
<p>Austin handed me a cup of hot liquid.  &quot;It'll wake you up and help with the hunger.  He took the urn too, she said about three hours ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We should get moving.&quot; I said.</p>
<p>Rhesus groaned still in his bedroll.</p>
<p>&quot;Get up you nit wit.&quot; I shouted.</p>
<p>But the spoiled brat didn't move quickly or much at all.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Is something wrong with Rhesus?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [7]+0 = 7)<br>
<strong>No</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>It was another hour or more before we were packed up and on the road.  We all made sure to fill our waterskins with fresh water from the bond.  It could heal us in a time of need, and it was refreshingly cool.</p>
<p>As I packed up my horse I noticed my map sticking slightly out of my pack.  It shouldn't be.  I unfurled the parchment and a torn not flit from the wrappings and settled on the ground.</p>
<p>The paper threatened to get away but I grabbed it quickly.  A note from Nyx. I read it slowly.  It was simple yet, why the fuck would he think he's a burden to me or anyone else.  But Rhesus' words had stung hard.  And he'd started two fires in two days.  Nyx was fragile when it came to the fire within.  Stronger than most people knew, but words were stronger than any axe or bow when it came to Nyx's self doubts.  I sighed as I looked up at the map and the glowing orange dot that rapidly moved away from us.  It wasn't far.</p>
<p>&quot;I think he's gone to do this thing by himself.&quot;</p>
<p>Rhesus shouted. &quot;That's not fair!  He can't have all the loot!&quot;</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes.  Nyx didn't care for any of that.  He wasn't rich, he wasn't poor but he didn't care for much outside his own personal happiness -- and mine. He was always trying to make me happy.  Fuck!</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe we can catch up to him?&quot;</p>
<p>Austin chuckled.  &quot;It looks like you both swapped roles.  He'll be our scout if we can follow behind him.  And you get to be our navigator.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let's go.&quot;  Rhesus demanded. &quot;We have to catch him.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Does anything hinder their travel?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [1]+0 = 1)<br>
<strong>No, and</strong> Oppress, Disease, Government</p>
<hr>
<p>We headed west in the direction we'd been going and past the former farmhouse.  In the rain and winds of the past day, the house no longer stood as a structure.  The fire weakened it if it did not burn it all away.  We edged the clearing as far from it as we could.  The lingering threat of whatever inside was not something we wanted to deal with.  The water sprites words still lingering in our ears -- my ears anyway.</p>
<p>Nyx's orange flicker on the map pulled away from us as we made our way through the forest.  My heart beat hard in my chest.  I worried for the frail boy I'd loved since I was a kid.</p>
<p>Aurora knickered at my thought.  I loved Nyx.  And I never told him.  And it weighed on my heart now that I might never see him again.  What if he died?</p>
<p>The longer the day drew on, the further Nyx pulled away from us.  &quot;He must be using magic to get farther from us.&quot; I sighed.</p>
<p>Austin pulled up alongside me on Whisper and looked at the map I held out for him to see.  He nodded. &quot;Looks that way.  We follow in his wake.  He's a smart lad.  He can take care of himself, and he's the little water nymph with him to protect against fires.  He'll be fine.&quot;  Austin said patting me on the shoulder.  &quot;We need to focus on us.&quot;  He pointed to a ruin in the swamps.  &quot;This is where we are going.  If you are right, that's where he is heading.  Keep us going this way, even if he goes another.  If he forsakes the journey we can lie and say he died and we buried him.  He has no family that will miss him -- 'cept you.&quot;</p>
<p>That was not a comforting thought as Austin pulled to catch up with Kis and Rhesus who were arguing about something.  Probably how slow the pony moved.  He was even less eager to learn that Nyx was pulling so far ahead.  He wanted whatever treasure lie at the ends of this journey.  Right now I just wanted to find Nyx.</p>

Nothing Special, continuing terrain</p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Anything interesting make them stop?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [12]+0 = 12)<br>
<strong>Yes, but</strong> Reflect, Shape, Luck</p>
<hr>
<p>Somewhere between midday and the sun setting an X appeared on the map.  &quot;Holy fuck!&quot;</p>
<p>Austin slowed Whisper and matched pace with me when I caught up.  I showed him the map.  &quot;Whatever he marks shows up. It's a bit jittery, he must be on his horse.  I wonder what he saw?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe he'll updated it when he stops?&quot;  Austin asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Sounds about right.  That's what he's been doing.  Marking all the spots.&quot;  I pointed to the wasp nest we encountered, the pond.  &quot;He's marking down generalities for it all.&quot;</p>
<p>Austin chuckled, &quot;It's too bad that glowing dot doesn't leave a trail. You two share quite the connection.  Magic like this just doesn't happen.&quot;</p>
<p>That was an interesting thought.</p>
<p>We stopped for the night and I watched the glowing dot continue to move until the sun was below the trees.  Nyx was in the wide open, alone.</p>
<p>I grabbed my pencil from my pouch and wrote in the margin of the map.  I hoped that it would work from myside too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love you. I'm sorry. Come back.</p>
