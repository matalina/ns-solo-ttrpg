<p>Nyx didn't stomp away.  He didn't so much as make a sound.  While these weren't the woods we grew up in exactly, they were woods none the same. Rhesus glared after him and Seralina pouted in her urn.  &quot;He'll be okay.&quot; I reassured her.  Though she hadn't seemed overly concerned with him before that moment.</p>
<p>She gave me a smile.  &quot;Must not be easy with living fire inside you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, it's not.  His emotions can spark a fire.  I'm going to check on him.  Welcome aboard.  And thank you.  Nyx needs a friend who can help him.&quot;</p>
<p>She giggled. &quot;Seems like he's got one already.&quot;</p>
<p>I shrugged.  &quot;Yeah, I dunno about that.&quot;  I said looking off after him.  &quot;I'm gonna go try though.&quot;</p>
<p>I got up and followed Nyx into the woods.  He wasn't too far ahead of me but he slipped through the trees and it would take me a while to find him.</p>

<p>I pushed past the brush and found Nyx leaning against a tree with a half smile on his lips.  &quot;You always follow me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you want to be alone?&quot; I asked.  &quot;I can leave.&quot;  I pointed back with my thumb over my shoulder.</p>
<p>He shook his head. &quot;Why does he hate me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's a spoiled brat.  He hates everyone who's not rich and powerful.&quot; I walked closer and Nyx's smile grew wider and the fire in his eyes brightened.  There was no denying that Nyx saw something he liked. Nyx flexed his fingers at  his sides and crossed them in front of him hugging himself tight.  The fire under his skin rose and the flickering in his eyes brightened.</p>
<p>I stopped moving towards him which drew a frown across his lips.  His gaze dropped to the ground and his voice was quiet as he spoke. &quot;I scare you.&quot;</p>
<p>I finished my approach and put my finger under his chin.  &quot;Never, Pretty Boy.&quot;  His eyes met mine but he hugged himself tighter.  Control was his ultimate goal.  He never got to be free, never could let the fires lose.  It was a struggle I would never understand because I never had to endure it.  One slip and he could burn down everything he loved.</p>
<p>There was fear in his eyes and sadness.  I wished I could take it all away.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's get that firewood.  I want to try something.&quot;</p>
<p>Nyx gave me a slight nod and pushed off the tree and moved away from me gathering sticks and leaves.</p>
<p>We were gone about half an hour before we returned to the others.  The fire pit was waiting our kindling and wood and Nyx easily started it.  While he was doing that I whispered to Austin, &quot;You mind making us a meal.  Nyx needs a swim and I want to try something.&quot;</p>
<p>Austin chuckled. &quot;Swimming and making out?&quot;  He nodded. &quot;I'm surprised you boys haven't tried that before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nyx wasn't ready.  Not sure he is now.  But I have to remind him  I'm not going anywhere.&quot;</p>
<p>Austin nodded and started pulling out some rations to make our evening meal.</p>
<p>I took Nyx by the hand and moved around the water sprites pond to someplace a little more secluded.  We couldn't get away completely, the pond wasn't very large, but there were enough bushes and trees we could find a semi-private place.</p>
<p>&quot;She said we could swim.  Maybe you can relax in the water.&quot;  I said as I pulled my coat from my shoulders.  Everything was still damp from the rains earlier.  And the water looked chilly.  I wasn't looking forward to taking a dip, but I disrobed anyway and Nyx waved his hand over them and they lost their dampness and neatly folded into a pile which he put a rock on top of so they didn't flutter away in the wind.</p>
<p>He watched me sink naked into the water.  His eyes glowing brightly and the flames flickering near the skin.  &quot;Come on in, the waters surprisingly warm.&quot;</p>
<p>Nyx looked around with a sigh and removed his clothes one piece at a time.  It could have been a slow sensual strip tease but I knew for Nyx it was born from shyness about what lie underneath.</p>
<p>The flames below his skin were nothing compared to the glowing lines that resembled feathers that were drawn over his skin.  The Phoenix feather tattoo's Saleh had called them were the very essence of his power.  They glowed brightly in the dying light of the day.  Nyx glowed with power he kept hidden under the thick dark clothes he wore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] Author's Note<br>
Decided that because every prompted ai picture kept putting Nyx in dark clothes that instead of being proud of his heritage, he's embarrassed/shy about the markings on his body and his attire has changed from what was previously stated -- so yes, this is a discrepancy in the writing :P</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He folded his clothes neatly and dried them the same as he had mine.  Another rock set upon them  and he stepped into the water.  Steam rose from his step and as he took another step the pond bubbled around his feet.  He was fucking hot.  And I meant that both literally and figuratively.  He was perfectly beautiful in every way, but he burned to the touch.  Touching him right now would be dangerous.  His emotions fed the fire inside.  It powered him.  But his control was perfect.  He held on so tight.</p>
<p>Knee deep and Nyx sat down in the water and then pushed off towards me on his back, submerged in the liquid.  There was a look of peace on his face, contentment.  His flaming hair was wet and looked more real then I had ever seen it.  His eyes were still burning coals and his skin flickered with the inner fire, the water glowed a warming orange but it didn't boil.</p>
<p>&quot;You okay?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>He smiled at me and lifted his head from the water and his arms and legs tred the water below.  &quot;Hmmm?&quot;  He mumbled like he was punch drunk.</p>
<p>&quot;You okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Better than ever.&quot;  Nyx said, &quot;The water is so cooling.&quot;  The cuts on Nyx's body were rapidly closing.  She hadn't at least lied about the healing properties of the water.</p>
<hr>
<p>Free Recovery Roll<br>
Nyx: 1d6+1: [3]+1 = 4<br>
Sasha: 1d6+1: [1]+1 = 2</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;Are you controlling the power or did you let it free?&quot; I asked pulling him closer to me with a hand on his hip.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know.&quot;  He whispered staring into my eyes biting his bottom lip.  The glow in his eyes I had seen many times over, seen his determination and his will to push forward.  He was fighting something, warring with something, and then his lips were on mine and there was a spark.  A literal spark as our lips touched.</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck!&quot;  I yelped.</p>
<p>The moment was broken and Nyx was scrambling out of the water.  &quot;Nyx, come back!&quot; I shouted after him as he scooped up his clothes and crashed through the brush away from the camp.  I knew tears were falling.  I knew I'd hurt him more than he'd hurt me.  And I knew he was going to tear himself up over it.  But if I followed this time, he'd throw fire -- quite literally.  The moment he was free of the pools magic his body had roared to full life.  He had to fight for his control.  His whole life burning around him and I was only trying to comfort him.</p>
<p>Dinner was ready when I dressed and sat by the camp fire.</p>
<p>We decided there was no need for camp the water sprites trusted the forest, so would we.  And we drifted to our bed rolls and Nyx still hadn't returned.  I tied to keep my eyes open and listen for him as I lie there staring up at the glittering leaves above.  But my eyelids sank shut and I slept soundly with the lapping of the pool against the shore and the rustling leaves of the Glowing Forest.</p>
