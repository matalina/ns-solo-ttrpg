<p>Nyx was down.  I felt it in the air but no one else seemed to notice as we followed Austin towards the goblin barricade.  We had a water sprite to save -- and save ourselves.  But I worried about Nyx.</p>
<p>I pulled Aurora up to Thunderbolt who stepped and pranced with renewed pride with the female so near.  He was such a showboat.  Nyx gave me a sideways smile to acknowledge my presence but he didn't look at me.  The flames underneath his skin flickered with ill-ease and I was surprised no one else noticed.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not your fault.&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&quot;What isn't?&quot; Nyx asked. &quot;I started the fire.  I broke the urn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;None of it's your fault.  Things break.  You know that.  The wind blows.  Did you cause the gust of wind?  I mean you were there to stop it.  The rest of us were ready to just leave it to burn uncontrolled.  But you wanted to stay.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because everything I touch turns to ash.&quot; Nyx said in the quietest whisper.  I barely heard his voice catch on the edge of a sob.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not...&quot; I started to reassure Nyx.</p>
<p>Austin held up his hand to stop and for us to be quiet as he dismounted Whisper and tied her to a branch.  We had reached the barricade.  And now it was time to see just what was really going on.</p>
<p>When Nyx dismounted he immediately pulled his fire around him.  It was a soft warm feeling and comforting yet frightening all at the same times.  Rhesus ran his palm across his axe and fueled his Rage.  We all readied for a battle.</p>
<p>I was first through to the nearby brush, crawling on my hands and knees until I could see the barricade through the trees without being seen by their lookouts.</p>

<hr>
<p>The moment I hunkered down the bushes around me disappeared and an alarm sounded in the barricade.  A horn rallied the troops from the center of the barricade and three scourges of goblins rushed out of their dwellings collecting their armaments and manning the tower in the front of the barricade.</p>

<p>Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I thought as I ran back towards the rest of the group with the goblins in hot pursuit.  Rhesus ran towards the leader of the group, but it fell long before either reached each other from the arrow that landed precisely in the Goblin Leader's eye.  It crumpled to the ground and did nothing to impeede the movement of the remaining goblins rushing their way.</p>
<p>Nyx took out the next rushing goblin with a fiery explosion shot from his hands.  The poor goblin didn't so much as die as it disintegrated from sight on the slight breeze in the air.  It was scary watching Nyx some days -- and others he was just an innocent boy who felt way too much.</p>
<p>The first three piled on top of me and I managed to evade all their blows.  As another three reached Rhesus and he shoved them from his body.</p>
<p>The last three headed for the inferno that was Nyx and while they struck his body they yelped as the flames about them did more damage to themselves with their blows.</p>

<p>I stabbed my dagger into one of the goblins attacking me and it howled in pain.  The second and third dropped with ease, one from an arrow to the back of the neck and the other from a fireball to the back.  Neither were as dramatic as the one before but the fell to the ground in a heap.</p>
<p>Rhesus swung his axed through the head of another goblin while the other two attacked him and their blades bounced off his armor.  All the hurt goblins turned tail and started a limped run towards the barricade.</p>

<p>As the fleeing goblin goes to leave I jammed my dagger into the back of it's shoulder and it falls to the ground with a sucking sound as my dagger pulls free.</p>
<p>A second swing of Rhesus axe chops the head off of a second goblin like a hot knife through butter.  Austin's arrow fells the third goblin that had taken some bad advice and attacked the raging prince.</p>
<p>Nyx felled a fleeing goblin, but the other 2 made it to safety on the other side of the barricade.  There was not a second wave.  We waited for several long moments before they started pounding the hilts of their daggers to their leathery chests and chanted. &quot;Katta Yashil! Katta Yashil! Bizni himoya qiling!&quot;</p>

<hr>
<p>From the brush to the north the trees swayed and rattled with a thump, thump of heavy feet falling on the earth below.  Trees cracked in it's path.  Whatever it was.</p>
<p>Nyx stepped closer to me his burning inferno still blazing brightly in the dim forest filtered light.</p>
<p>Crunch. Crunch.</p>
<p>Rhesus charged towards the sound.</p>
<p>Austin knocked another arrow.</p>
<p>Kis cowered behind the tree he'd found, and scurried away with the giant of a goblin ambled forward. His large voice boomed, &quot;Xafa bo'lmang do'stlar!&quot;</p>

<p>This time I didn't understand what it said.  I really sucked at puzzles.  I musta hard that term before -- maybe something Saleh warned us about.</p>
<p>I joked, &quot;Maybe he wants to dance?&quot;</p>
<p>Rhesus laughed and the Big Green Goblin stomped his feet in fury.  He raised a gauntleted hand and a blast of fire shot from the gloved fingers.  All but Nyx jumped out of the way.  The inferno enveloped him and he just smiled.</p>

<p>Nyx stands in the burning blasted area and the large goblin cocks his head to the side as he starts speaking.</p>

<p>The big goblin looks at the barricade and all the goblins below shuffle their feet and look the other direction.  They all understood Nyx. I was mildly impressed with the shy boy I knew standing his ground.</p>
<p>The big goblin squated down in front of Nyx who still raged with fire in the burning underbrush and asked. &quot;Do'stlar xafa bo'lmadimi?&quot;</p>

<p>Nyx shook his head. &quot;No we won't hurt your friends.  We just want the girl in the cage.&quot;</p>

<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Does Big Green give them the water sprite?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [14]+0 = 14)<br>
<strong>Yes</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>The Big green goblin looks at the goblins in the barricade and a small redish green goblin brings the water sprite in her iron cage to the edge of the flaming circle left by the goblin's fireblast.</p>
<p>It shouted &quot;Ket!&quot;.  The rest of the goblins chanted the same word over and over pounding their dagger hilt to their leathery chest.</p>
<blockquote>

Leave!</p>

<p>Nyx turned to us and smiled. &quot;They want us to leave.&quot;  He walked through the flaming circle and picked up the water sprites cage and when he was clear of all the fire he dropped the shroud of flames.  But he only paused long enough to get his horse and lead him away -- in an easterly direction.  We had to return the sprite to her mother.</p>
