<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Are there any complications on the way back to the water sprite.</em><br>
(1d20+0: [8]+0 = 8)<br>
<strong>No, but</strong> Flee, Few, Priest</p>
<hr>
<p>I was riding the high of getting the water sprite.  But she was whining as I got away from the goblin barricade.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me out!&quot; the water sprite squawked weakly from her iron cage.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's just get away from here, find a clearing or just away.  I promise I'll let you out.&quot;</p>
<hr>

Storage, Moan, Burial<br>
(1d20: [15] = 15)</p>
<hr>
<p>She whined more. &quot;You are just like the goblins.  Mean and killing me.&quot;</p>
<p>I sighed and stopped just out of sight of the goblin's home.  The cage was locked. I looked to Sasha. &quot;Can you open it?&quot;</p>
<p>He took the cage from we with a wink.  &quot;Let me see.&quot; The lock didn't look difficult but Sasha made a show of it tossing the little annoying water sprite around as he adjusted the cage in the dimming light.</p>
<hr>

(1d20: [5] = 5)</p>
<hr>
<p>Sasha pulled his lockpicking set from his bag and the minute he started picking the lock his pick snapped.  &quot;Fuck!&quot;</p>
<p>And as if the bad luck wouldn't stop the rain fell from the sky in buckets and we all rushed for the cover of a large leafed tree near by.</p>
<p>The water sprite giggled with glee with the falling rain forgetting about the cage for the moment as she absorbed the water.  She looked much brighter in the falling rain so I set her just outside the cover and she beamed brightly at me.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll get you out.  I promise.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Persuade the water sprite (9)</em><br>

<hr>
<p>Her smile faded as she turned towards the rain. She still didn't beleive me.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to get to her mother.  We don't know how much time we have left.&quot;  Sasha urged us back on to the road.</p>
<p>We all mounted up, I hung the water sprite from the back of my saddle with a bit of rope from my pack and we headed off in the direction Sasha lead us.</p>
<p>Sasha lead the way to the pond at a break neck speed.  We almost slide down the side of a hill once because he moved us too fast through the soft terrain.  He apologized profusely but he kept looking back at me -- waiting for any signs of my discomfort.  I was only wet and tired, it had been a stressful day. And it just rained and rained as we traveled the short distance to the pond.</p>
<p>The clearing was in view and the rain lessened and then stopped around the pond where the water sprite lived.  The sprite on the back of my saddle pouted a little. &quot;I didn't wanna come home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where did you wanna go?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>She shrugged, &quot;Anywhere but here.  Please take me with you.  I only need a little water.  And out of this cage.&quot;</p>
<p>The creature in the pond swirled and hovered over the water clapping her hands.  &quot;Oh you did it.  Seralina, it's so good to have you home. Let her out!&quot; She demanded.</p>
<p>I sighed.  &quot;We can try again.&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha was the first one off his horse and tying Aurora to a nearby tree so she could graze and drink from the pond.  &quot;First payment, then we'll work on getting her out.  We can't get her out if we are dead!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mother!&quot;  Seralina shouted, &quot;You didn't.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did no such thing.  There was never any danger.  Only the thought of one.&quot; She giggled.  &quot;But you may swim in the waters, and heal.  And you may take a vessel each when you leave.  It can heal and replenish as long as you are in the Glowing Forest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I want to go with them mother.&quot;</p>
<p>Austin stood next to the cage still mounted on my horse and shook his finger, &quot;We are going dangerous places, this is not an adventure for the ill trained.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She can stay with the horses and Kis.&quot; Sasha suggested.  &quot;I think we'd all like to do that, wouldn't we?&quot;  Sasha grinned at me.</p>
<p>Austin growled, and looked at Rhesus, &quot;It's his decision.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What good does a water sprite do us?&quot;  He asked. &quot;They are just nuisances playing tricks on us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure Seralina has some talents.  Don't you?&quot; I pulled her cage from the saddle and draped the reins over a branch so Thunderbolt could graze and drink at his leisure.  And then I sat down next to the water and looked at the lock.  I didn't have tools to open it.</p>
<p>I opened up my bag and pulled things out, one by one seeing if I could find anything useful.  I placed the urn at the edge of the water and it drew the attention of both water elementals. &quot;What's that?&quot; Seralina asked.</p>
<p>&quot;The Urn of Unending Water.  But it's broken now.&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&quot;I can fix it.&quot;  She said.  &quot;And it will get me out of here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>Sasha was sitting next to now with curious grin to his lips.  &quot;Give it to me.&quot; He reached across my body and took the urn from my hands and gave me a smile only for me.  I dropped my gaze and felt the flamed ignite inside.  I took a moment of deep breathing to calm the fires.  Only Sasha could do that.</p>
<p>He uncapped the urn and pointed it at the water sprite.  A loud sucking sound pulled at the water sprite trapped inside the urn and soon she was a swirling mass of water and being sucked into the urn.</p>
<p>&quot;Cap it!&quot;  She said faintly in the aether of magic that had once been the magical vessel.</p>
<p>Sasha put the lid on and it glowed with blue light.  The crack in the side that had manifested when I broke it healed like skin knitting together.  And then the lid popped open and Seralina giggled and spun with joy.  &quot;Oh I love it.  Now I can go with you.  I will help now.  Keep you safe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can the urn still put out fires?&quot;  Sasha asked.</p>
<p>Seralina giggled. &quot;Of course.  I can do that for you.&quot;  She splashed water from the urn and it drenched Sasha from head to toe.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey.&quot; Sasha laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess you can come with us then.  We need your talents.&quot;</p>
<p>Rhesus growled. &quot;He needs your talents.&quot;  He pointed at Nyx, &quot;Two fires in just as many days.  You should have stayed home.&quot;</p>
<p>My heart sank and I stood up in one graceful move. &quot;I'm going to get some firewood.  Looks like a good place to spend the night!&quot;</p>
