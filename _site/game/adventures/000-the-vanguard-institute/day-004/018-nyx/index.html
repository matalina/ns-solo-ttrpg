<p>The might was fitful, the dreams were the same.  I was a sacrifice to Ardere, the Great Phoenix.  The same Phoenix that I'd been in the vision in the fire. The glowing lines on my body were cut into my skin, healed by the power of the phoenix and what gave me my power.  That was what the dreams told me.  But were they real?</p>
<p>Or were they just figments of my imagination.</p>
<p>I knew of only one place that could help -- The Church of the Phoenix.  Saleh had forbidden me from talking to the cult in Oceana.  But after this initiation I could do what I wanted.  I would speak to the high priestess there in town when we got back.</p>
<p>But for now I had to find that staff and venture forth into the world alone, well with my new found friends.  Kinda anyway.  I missed Sasha.  I wished I hadn't left.  But I couldn't back down now, no matter how much I wanted to.  I just wanted to be with Sasha.  He wanted to be with me.</p>
<p>I glanced at the note left in the margins and wondered what he was doing as he rode through the forest.  What would they see that I didn't in the dark.</p>
<p>My day was uneventful.  Seralina and Cimmeris chatted in their respective vessels while Xit flit around us on his wings, sometimes perching on Thunderbolt's head or rump to rest.  It was oddly quiet through our journey, much more enjoyable now.</p>
<p>We stopped for a midday meal, and then started again.  Nothing happened on the plains it seemed.  They were boring and flat and not even a tree in sight.</p>
<p>The village ahead came into view at least an hour before we reached it.  The closer we drew to the village, the darker the sky felt, and not just because the sun was setting.  There was a heavy weight upon the village.  Everything felt suffocating to me.</p>
<p>Even my other companions felt it, at least their chatter stopped and Seralina hid in her urn away from prying eyes as we stepped onto the dirt road that lead north away from the village, but we went past the nearly abandoned farms into the village proper.  Xit hid in my saddle bags.  My friends left me to fend for myself it seemed.  Thunderbolt danced nervously as we trod through the street.  The lake beyond the village was black.  I imagined it was just as dark in the daylight as it was in the fading sun.</p>

<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Does anyone approach Nyx?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [12]+0 = 12)<br>
<strong>Yes, but</strong> Unsophisticated, Awful, Familiar</p>
