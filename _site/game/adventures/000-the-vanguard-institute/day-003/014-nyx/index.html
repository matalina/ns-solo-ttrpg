<p>[!note] Author's Note<br>
For a while now it has been in our head to separate Nyx from Sasha. So the above roll is that random determination because I'm torn.  We love throwing in complications for the boys, but this might make following the writing that much harder. Definitely considering getting to a certain point with one and then getting the other to that same day and switch them back.  So we'll see how it goes.  Not decided yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>&quot;I hate you!&quot; Sasha yelled.</p>
<p>My eyes popped open and I found myself still sitting in a hollowed out tree where I'd taken shelter to come down from my embarrassment.  The sun was still down, the glow of the forest was ominous and I felt lost and alone, even though I knew the camp wasn't more than the other side of the thicket of trees.</p>
<p>My heart raced, blood rushed to every part of my body and the power inside flickered with passion and heat of the dream I'd woken myself from.  A simple kiss had hurt Sasha and my mind played horrible tricks on me.  The whole thing was hard to shake.  Sasha hating me was the worst thing in the world.  He was my world.  He had been since my very first memory.  Saleh took care of us from infants left on the Institutes door step.  We were like brothers -- and then some.  But there was always a distance between us.  A distance we had closed in the water only for my power to spark between us hurting him.  I ran away embarrassed, and Sasha hadn't followed.  Maybe he thought it was a mistake?</p>
<p>I was a mistake?</p>
<p>But I was more than that.  I was a burden.</p>
<p>I made my way back to camp in the dark silence of the night.  Everyone slept in their bedrolls and I packed my things with ease.  I wasn't quite as stealthy as Sasha but I could hold my own.</p>

<p>I picked up the urn and Seralina woke from her slumber inside.  I held my finger to my lips and whispered. &quot;Let's go adventuring.&quot;</p>

(1d20: [3] = 3)</p>
<hr>
<p>A wide smile grew across her lips and she perked up and stayed quiet as I tied the urn to the back of Thunderbolt.</p>
<p>He stomped and pawed at the ground but otherwise made little noise as  I finished preparing to leave.  I took a piece of paper from my book and left Sasha a note.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sasha, I'm sorry. I'm going to prove to you I'm not a burden. ~Nyx</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Nyx spends 1XP for a Cypher that connects his and Sasha map so they always know where each other are.</p>
<hr>
<p>I rustled through Sasha's bag and pulled out his map and I laid the two together and concentrated the powers Saleh taught me.  It wasn't something I'd cast before, but I knew in theory I could do it.  The magic came easily in this place of magic and I connected the two maps.  Twin dots, one a flaming orange and the other a dull purple shadow flickered on top of each other.  I drew a pond on Sasha's map and watched as it appeared on mine.  Perfectly connected.  I grinned at the magic around us and whispered, &quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>A splash from the pool drew my attention and the water sprite smiled brightly at me before she dipped off into the water after waving at the two of us.  She kept her silence, and watched as we both departed from the other side of the pool.</p>
<p>The note was neatly rolled up in the map and I stuck it back in his backpack.  I stared at his sleeping form for a moment longer before grabbing Thunderbolt's reins and silently departing the clearing of the pond and heading out into the still glowing forest with I didn't know how many hours of darkness ahead of me.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Does anything waylay Nyx and Seralina in their departure?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [6]+0 = 6)<br>
<strong>No</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Does anything interrupt their journey during the day?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [1]+0 = 1)<br>
<strong>No, and</strong> Guest, Unthinking, Hollow</p>
<hr>
<p>Time before sunrise: 1d6: [3] = 3</p>
<p>Nyx spends another 1XP to double his travel speed so he can out pace Sasha the first day</p>
<hr>
<p>They traveled in relative silence in the darkness.  It was slow moving in the darkness and Nyx carefully watched the map as he parted ways from Sasha.  When the sun finally rose there was only a small distance between them on the map.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to be further away.&quot; I said mostly to the air.</p>
<p>Seralina nodded. &quot;The magic of the pool still resides in the water until the edge of the pool.  We can do that.&quot;</p>
<p>I concentrated on the power of the urn and the affect I wished to create and soon Thunderbolt was flying through the forest, bounding in and out of bushes at double time.  It was amazing.  I tucked in low, close to Thunderbolt's neck and guided him in the idea of the direction we needed to.<br>
Trees rustled around us, but we leapt through the air over the danger and Thunderbolt kept running.  He was free and had the wind in his mane.  He was alive.  I felt it in waves.</p>
<p>Seralina giggled behind me, holding on to her urn like it was her life boat, and perhaps it was.  But she didn't ask to stop, she laughed with as much glee as Thunderbolt ran.  They were both free.</p>
<p>And even in the spirit of the adventure I still felt like I was being a burden on Sasha -- maybe even more now that he would be forced to look for me.  He always wanted to take care of me.  I sighed with sadness I already missed my best friend.</p>
<p>The trees broke way into the plains.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Plains<br>
(1d100: [76] = 76)<br>
Interesting Feature -&gt; Watch tower (1d100: [26] = 26)</p>
<hr>
<p>A tower of some sort to our south poked into view, but we kept riding.  I did manage to mark a quick x on the map where it might be.  I'd draw it proper when we stopped for the night.</p>
<p>By the time the spell slowed the distance between our dots had grown further apart -- almost double the distance.  And the moon was nearing its peak.</p>
<p>&quot;We should stop and rest.&quot;</p>
<p>Thunderbolt whinnied.</p>
<p>Seralina giggled softly, &quot;I think he agrees.&quot;</p>
