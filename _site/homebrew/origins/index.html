      <h1>Origins</h1>
<p>All characters have an origin.  Make a choice for each of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a Shift in which your character came from (Color #)</li>
<li>Choose an ability that caters to your origin and your backstory <em>(subject to GMs approval)</em></li>
<li>Choose an inability that detracts from your origin and your back story (a flaw of some sort -- you may opt out of #2 and #3 if you opt out of both) <em>(subject to GMs approval)</em></li>
<li>Choose 1 skill in which you are trained that is a hobby</li>
<li>Explain each of these choices in your back story</li>
<li>Choose either to be a Drifter or an Anchor</li>
<li>If you are a Drifter who is your current Anchor? (if you don't have one explain.)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Drifter</h2>
<p>A drifter can travel easily between Shifts.  But if a drifter is not properly bound to an anchor they will drift from shift to shift with no way back home.</p>
<h3>Abilities</h3>
<p><strong>Drift (2+ Intellect point):</strong> You and your anchor can drift to another Shift. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to bring other people with you; each level of Effort used in this way affects up to two additional targets. You must touch any additional targets. Action.</p>
<p><strong>Determine Shift (1 Intellect point):</strong> Determine what shift an entity is from just by looking at their aura. Action.</p>
<h2>Anchor</h2>
<p>Most people are anchors and are tied to one place -- their home shift.  With training an anchor can bond with a drifter</p>
<p><strong>Bond (1 Intellect point):</strong> Bond with a drifter through a special ceremony.  May only have one bond at a time. Action to initiate.</p>
<p><strong>Mental Link with Drifter:</strong> The same as Mental Link except there is no cost and you can only link with your drifter. (161) In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to extend the duration by one hour for each level of Effort applied. Action to initiate.</p>
<p><strong>Create Anchor  (1+ Intellect point):</strong> Create an anchor to pull themselves and their drifter (and party if included) back to the anchor from another shift. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to bring other people with you; each level of Effort used in this way affects up to two additional targets. You must touch any additional targets. Action to initiate.</p>
<h2>Shifts</h2>
<p>Shifts consist of a color and a number.  Each color represents the type of world your character hales from, and the number is the distance from the Nexus your shift is found in regards to the major differences in your world.</p>

<p><strong>Shift #0</strong> (has no color) -&gt; this is the real world as we the player knows it.  This is also the shift Arcadis is in.</p>
<p><strong>Purple #45</strong> vampires and werewolves and other associated supernatural creatures are real -&gt; Supernatural</p>
<p><strong>Blue #125</strong> the steam engines became the predominate form of locomotion (electricity was not invented) -&gt; Steampunk</p>
<p><strong>Cyan #3</strong> aliens landed and shared their tech with Earth in the late 1800s -&gt; Hard Sci-fi</p>
<p><strong>Yellow #10</strong> World War 2 ended in a nuclear war devastating the world making a barren waste land -&gt; Post Apocalypse</p>
<p><strong>Red #236</strong> During the dark ages magic became well known and used throughout the world -&gt; High Fantasy</p>
<p>When creating a different world the historical differences do not need to be taken into consideration, but remember that the higher the number, the more things have changed in the past in order to make the changes you wish to happen in the future.  You can use the examples above as guidelines.</p>
<p>As a side note: Arcadis only Shifts in the purple zone. All other zones only create real world derivatives.</p>
