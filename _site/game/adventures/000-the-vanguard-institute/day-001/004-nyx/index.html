<p>Mesmerizing flames flicked the sky, whirlwinds of red and gold spun across the land dancing with the pools and streams of lava between fiery volcanos dripping with molten rock and geysers of hot liquid from pores and crevices across the dark obsidian lands. It was hot and splendid and home.</p>
<p>Sitting atop an obsidian spire, in a nest of rock and ash, wings fluttering all around.  Home.  Family.</p>
<p>Darkness flooded the vision.  Swirling fire and ash encompassing your being.  The shadows of your world fading from your vision as others mixed in.  Blues and greens showered your eyes with strange  hues.  The air was chilling.  The sky dimmed into darkness dotted with strange speaks of light.  A single moon shown above the land.</p>
<p>So cold!  So alone.</p>
<p>The smell of burning hair and flesh permuted the air and chucks of flesh and debris dotted your vision as you took in your new surroundings.</p>
<p>Where something once stood now lay a crater.  Deep and dark and wide.  Everything burned, but not like where you'd been only moments before.  Nothing living remained.</p>
<p>A singular cry in the darkness pulled at your ears.  At first you thought it was your own cry of loneliness until it sounded again.  In the darkness, a glowing vessel burning from the heat of your entrance cried again.</p>
<p>You tipped it over and a crying child tumbled from the burning container.  The only survivor.  His hair was golden with flames, eyes of orange glowing with fire.  Bloodied symbols on painted on the forehead and naked body of the tiny child.</p>
<p>A tear slid down your beak and on to the child.  A feather pressed against his chest.  And a whispered word, 'live' in a language unknown to the ears that heard it.  The child wreathed in flames and when they subsided into his skin, an all new glow filtered across his skin.</p>
<p>You grasped the naked babe in a fiery talon and lifted off into the sky and flew away with the child cooing in your grasp.</p>

<p>Sasha caught up and tried to talk to me.  I was still lost in that vision.  The world felt different seeing things from that vision.  It was colder now, even though the weather was still a nice spring day.  I felt a connection to things I didn't really understand.  And Sasha watched me with careful calculation.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't have to babysit me.&quot; I whispered into the breeze.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not.&quot; Sasha said.  &quot;I shouldn't have said it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That you were thinking about leaving me?&quot; I asked with accusing eyes.</p>
<p>He sighed. &quot;I'm not thinking about it.  But I might die, or I don't know...&quot;  Sasha let the sentence hang in the air.  I wasn't sure what was worse than dying, falling in love with someone else?  Finding a new friend who he didn't need to babysit?</p>
<p>&quot;Nyx.&quot;  Sasha stopped and grabbed my elbow. &quot;I know you.  I know what's going through your head.  So stop it. Right now. I. Am. Not. Going. Any. Where.&quot; He punctuated each word with a gab of his finger into my heart.  &quot;You are my family.  Through everything.  Yes, I need space.  Yes, you are clingy.  But I will always love you, Nyx.  You are my family. Get out of your head or you are going to burn every fucking thing down.  Including yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>He wasn't wrong.</p>
<p>We reached the gate and we left the reins hang on the archway that stood over the Institutes front gate.  Aurora and Thunderbolt grazed while we waited for the others.</p>
<p>I sat down with my back to the post and Sasha watched with that overprotective nature he always had.  &quot;And besides, Nyx, I like taking care of you.&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha pulled a brown package from his saddle bags and sat down next to me.  &quot;I got you something.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What for?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Because I knew you'd need it.  And I know you didn't eat breakfast this morning.&quot;</p>
<p>I grinned at my friend, biting my bottom lip and blushing.  He knew me better than anyone else.  Maybe I had sparked for more than just the surprise of Willow's snap.  I was nervous.  Nervous about being mostly alone with Sasha, and out in the world beyond the gates of the Institute.  Far away from the only place I'd ever known.</p>
<p>I opened the package and on top was a block of cheese and bread for me to nibble on, but there was a peice of parchment separating the food from what lie beneath.  &quot;What's this?&quot; I pulled the black fabric from the package and set the food aside plunging a peice of bread into my mouth before unfurling the fabric.</p>
<p>A beaded black cloak with large hood  shimmered before me.</p>
<p>Sasha smiled. &quot;I know you aren't ashamed of your glow, and that you like to be seen.  But there will be times we want to hide.  We'll need to hide, and you aren't very good at it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I glow.&quot; I giggled.</p>
<p>Sasha smiled. &quot;Always, Nyx.  I'm not trying to hide you all the time, just when we need to.  It's pretty, and shimmers in the light with the beads.  I even had them make it feathery patterned bead worth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's wonderful.&quot; I said and stood up and threw the black cloak around my shoulders and pulled the hood up.  &quot;Does it work?&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha nodded.  &quot;It does.&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha stood up and looked at me with those stunning gray eyes and I wanted...</p>
<p>A holler from the direction of the stables drew our attention and I turned around before I could finish the thought.  A shimmering orange and blue Kobold came scampering past with two steeds in tow.  One was Willow, and the other a small pony called Sunny.  Rhesus was chasing the Kobold.</p>
<p>&quot;Give me back my horse!&quot; he cried.</p>
