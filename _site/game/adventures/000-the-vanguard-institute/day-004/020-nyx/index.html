<p>The room was a hole in the wall, about the size of the door itself, barely any walking room, but it had a bed and a basin to wash up in.  Not that I really needed that, between my magic and Seralina, water was pretty common place for us.  A heated bath was easy when you could heat the thing without effort.</p>
<p>But I plopped down in the bed and glanced at the notes Sasha had left and scribbled my own.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wishing you were here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried to sleep but the noise carried up through the floorboards.  People shambled across the floor above me, and down the hall clattering and knocking things over.  Sleep was far and few between.  But I did manage to rest my eyes just long enough that when a big burly man barged into my room with his cock hanging out and his pants around his ankle and a girl struggling to get away in his large hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh good.  Another one.&quot;  He said as he flung the girl in my direction.</p>
<p>She landed on top of me in a crying heap, pleading.  &quot;Please, leave me alone.&quot;</p>
<p>I quickly shielded the girl behind me and stood up bearing the shroud of flames once I was away from the bed.</p>
<p>&quot;I think you need to leave.&quot; I said.</p>
<p>The man glared at me.</p>

<p>The man trips over his pants around his legs as he advances but he clobbers me in the face none-the-less.  But as he falls I reach out and cast a sleeping spell, chanting the foreign words as he stumbles and the utterly collapses on the floor as the spell takes effect.</p>
<p>The smell of fermenting ale and piss permeate from the man and the girl moves to kick him.</p>
<p>I drop the flames and grab her arm, whispering calmly to her, &quot;If you do that you'll wake him.  Let's just get out of here.&quot;</p>
<p>I step around the fallen man quietly and help the girl over his wide chest.  Xit grabs my things and hopes on my shoulder offering the backpack to me.  &quot;Sorry, guys, no bed tonight.&quot;</p>
<p>And we slip out the back door with the girl in tow.</p>
<p>She follows me to the edge of town looking back nervously.</p>
<p>&quot;Can I come with you?&quot;</p>
<p>I stop and turn.  Blinking in confusion at the request.  &quot;Don't you have a family here?&quot;</p>
<p>She shook her head, then looked back.  &quot;No.&quot;  She looked like she wanted to say something more, but her nerves got the better of her.  &quot;I should get back.&quot;  she said.  &quot;He'll notice I'm gone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can't go back to him!&quot;</p>
<p>She bit her bottom lip and started to cry.  The tears streamed down her dirty face and I sighed. &quot;You can come with me, but it's no place for someone like you.&quot;</p>
<p>The words weren't out of my mouth before she was reaching up to throw a punch.  Her fist landed squarely in my nose and I rocked backwards.  My companions were chuckling, Seralina was giggling raucously from her urn as she watched from the crack in the ceramic.</p>
<p>&quot;You're crazy!&quot; She said running off into the direction we had fled.</p>
<p>Me?  I'm the crazy one?  Whatever I sighed and started east again.  I needed away from this town.  I supposed I would have to hunt for some more rations.</p>
<p>I gave a simple whistle and Thunderbolt whined.  I walked away from the town never looking back.  There were no shouts and screams as Thunderbolt joined me on my walk.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Does anyone follow Nyx?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [2]+0 = 2)<br>
<strong>No, and</strong> Percussive, Guest, Seat</p>
<hr>
<p>After about an hour of walking I found a place to settle in for the night.  Thunderbolt grazed nearby, happy to be free from the stables.  He never liked being tied up anyway.</p>
<p>A bit away from my camp I set up a snare in the hopes that I might catch a rabbit or prairie dog or something -- anything really.  Food was going to be hard to come by sooner rather than later.</p>

<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Anything happen in the night?</em><br>

<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Someone from the village find him?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [4]+0 = 4)<br>
<strong>No</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Snare catch something bigger than vermin?</em><br>

<p>A sound woke me from my dreams -- good dreams of Sasha and me back home mixed with the kiss from the pond.  It was a good dream and I blinked awake startled by a woman sitting at my dying fire.  Hunched over cooking a rabbit on a skewer.</p>
<p>&quot;Figured you might need some food since you left in a hurry.&quot; She said.</p>
<p>&quot;Do I know you?&quot; I said.  She looked familiar in the flickering firelight.</p>
<p>She shook her head. &quot;No.  But I know you.  Nyx U'rah de'Saleh, a child of the phoenix.  A rare child.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How do you know who I am?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've watched you. You and your changeling friend.  We've kept an eye on you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're the person Sasha's supposed to meet in Darkwell.&quot; I guessed.</p>
<p>Her smile was bright.  &quot;He told you?&quot;</p>
<p>I shook my head. &quot;No. I saw the note in his backpack when I left mine.&quot;  I looked upon the woman's person, but things were hard to see in the flickering light, but she wore an black gem around her throat.   She was<br>
part of the Obsidian Syndicate.  And she'd been watching us both?</p>
<p>&quot;Why are you helping me?&quot;</p>
<p>She gave me a warm smile and handed me the rabbit on a stick.  &quot;It is in my best interest to do so.  You are a smart kid, getting away from the village was your best move.  Keep going.  I'll make sure Sasha knows you are alright.&quot;</p>
<p>She left a bag at the edge of the fire and lopped off into the darkness.</p>
<p>Xit was first to the bag and bringing it to me with a chittering of happiness.</p>
<hr>
<p>Contents of the bag:<br>
1d6 meals 1d6: [6] = 6<br>
1d4 inexpensive pocket items 1d4: [1] = 1<br>
1d4 Cypher 1d4: [4] = 4<br>
Nyx takes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>L7 Nutrition and Hydration:</strong> The user can go without food and water for a number of days equal to the cypher's level without ill effect. (393)</li>
<li><strong>L7 Detonation:</strong> Projects a small physical explosive up to a long distance away that explodes in an immediate radius, inflicting Heat drain (cold) damage equal to the cypher's level.(386)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>A few meals and trinkets were wrapped neatly in the bowels of the sack.  All of which I put into my backpack and continued my rest.  I still had a long ways to go before we were where I needed to be.</p>
