<p>We stopped for the night in the middle of an open plain.  It looked like it might have had other camps, the grass was flattened, and the pile of embers hadn't been overgrown.  Maybe it was Nyx's camping spot.</p>
<p>I imagined where he might have sat, what he might have done.  As the sun faded I saw scorch marks on the ground and wondered what might have happened.  But even through my half of the watch nothing of note took place, nothing to tell me what might have happened to Nyx on his stay here.</p>
<p>I kept his last note on the margin and added another.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sleep well and dream of me.  I'll meet you there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nyx didn't reply, sleep had probably taken him -- in a bed with warm food in his belly.  Needless to say I missed his warmth on the cool spring night.</p>
<p>Kis woke me when the sun rose, I was lost in the dreams of my fiery pretty boy and wishing I never had to wake from them.  The day was bright and sleep had been restful if not comfortable.  Even Rhesus looked better for a few hours of shut eye.  Maybe the spoiled brat was getting used to living on the road -- doubtful, but one could only hope.</p>
<p>We made breakfast and headed east where Nyx was already moving.  Tonight I'd get a bed.  If we kept up pace and weren't stopped by anything out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>Much of the morning went well.  Much of the afternoon as well.  The sounds of the plains was predominately silence, but something eerily slithered over my skin as we moved into the evening hours.</p>
<p>A dark swath of dying grass laid before us.  The rustled of the brittle leaves cut off in the wind and disintegrated as we passed through.</p>
<p>Austin knocked his arrow and I readied myself for a battle.  Rhesus who was on point did nothing more than look about.</p>
<p>In the distance a dark figure shambled towards the town of Darkwell, that had come into view only a minute before we saw its shadowed guise.</p>
<p>All of us dismounted and Austin loosed his arrow at the shambling creature.  Better to kill it now then let it get to town.  And Rhesus prepares with a charging run.  Kis takes the horses and stays out of the way like a good little kobold squire.</p>

<hr>
<p>The arrow flies true and deals a massive amount of damage as the thing shambles around and meets me at the edge of my shadow walk.  It wasn't the first time I'd used the power and it was always a little disorienting for both me and the creature.  It's swing missed as I stumbled.  Rhesus continued his charge, while Austin's next arrow landed dead in an eye socket, but it continued it's onslaught of claws on my body and raked across my chest as I stumbled from the stepping before.</p>
<p>Rhesus axe cleaved the creature clean in two when he drew near enough to swing without hitting me.  The look on his face was pure rage.  Blood red eyes and his face nearly matched the color of his eyes.  He turned his gaze upon me and I took a step back.  He'd lost control before -- not on this mission, but before, in training.</p>
<p>I saw the switch in his mind when it flipped.  The rage oozed from his body and left him weak and concerned for what he did.</p>
<p>&quot;Just the thing is dead.  It's okay.&quot;  I reassured him.</p>
<p>Rhesus looked at me and the injury.  &quot;I'm fine.&quot; I said.  &quot;I'll heal.&quot;</p>
<p>Wasn't as bad as it looked, nor felt, but it would ache and might leave a scar.  Chicks dug scars so the saying went.  I wondered what Nyx's thoughts on scars were.  Or even what he'd think of the less then ideal body beneath the dark clothes.  As a changeling my body was non-descript in its origin.  Nothing to write home about.  No amount of working out would change the musculature.  I could learn to hold the form, but my skills there didn't work as well -- not yet.  Maybe someday as I learned more about it.  But that was difficult when you didn't have a changeling teacher.  It was part instinct, but there was skill involved too.</p>
<p>Kis returned to us with our horses and we all mounted and headed into town.  Darkwell was a shit hole if you asked me.  Nothing looked right.  And I had a person to meet.  Things to do.  But I glanced at the map and watched as Nyx's orange glowing dot got further from me.  I had a choice to make.</p>
