<hr>
<p>The messages from Nyx were nice.  I still needed to follow him, to go after him.  But I might worry less, I knew where he was.  I could talk to him, which was absolutely amazing.  Whatever spell he did, he should do on a journal and then we can always have each other nearby.  Not that the map wasn't comforting.  The added words seconds later made me smile.  He hesitated, not because he didn't feel that way, but because he knew me.  Knew I might run.  I said it first.  I had.  I meant it and my heart swooned.</p>
<p>Everyone one else was bedding down and I stayed up for first watch.  Austin pointed to Rhesus, you take this watch too.  No one sits alone.  Kis and I will take second.</p>
<p>&quot;Why are you in charge now?&quot; Rhesus complained.</p>
<p>&quot;Because you won't take a shift if I didn't say so.&quot; Austin said.</p>
<p>The brat just glared at him but he sat down next to me and Austin and Kis drifted into their bed and off to sleep.</p>
<p>&quot;What's the grin for?&quot;  Rhesus asked.</p>
<p>I shook my head. &quot;Just happy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why do you like him anyway? He's weird.&quot;  Rhesus said looking away from the fire and into the darkness.</p>
<p>&quot;He is weird, but he's also nice and sweet.  And honestly, he's hot as fuck.&quot;  I said.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't mean that literally.&quot;  Rhesus said, a slight reddish hue to his ears.</p>
<p>&quot;You've noticed as well.  Is that why you hate him so much?&quot;  I asked. &quot;And hate me because I'm his friend.  Can't get him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's pretty blinded by you.&quot; Rhesus intoned with a bit of anger.</p>
<p>A pair of glowing eyes peaked through the shadows.  I nodded in the direction of the tree it perched in.  Rhesus turned and eyed it and shouted. &quot;Get!&quot;  He tossed his arms in the arm and whatever flying creature had been fluttered away in a hurry -- didn't want to be bothered by the annoying brat of a boy.</p>
<p>&quot;You didn't have to scare it away.  It was just an owl.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just like last night it was just a bee.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A wasp but it wasn't attacking us this time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Probably only attacked cause Nyx was here.&quot; Rhesus grumbled, &quot;He seems all sorts of trouble magnet.&quot;</p>
<p>I chuckled.  I didn't deny that.  He was trouble, that was for sure.  It always seemed to find him.</p>
<p>Rhesus nodded off several times.  I tossed a rock at his feet two times before I gave up and let him snore.  It was nice having quiet time.  I could think about Nyx and the map.  And I could wonder what was in store for me in Darkwell.  I missed Nyx when a strong gust of wind nearly gutted the fire, but it fought as much as Nyx might and it made me smile.</p>
<p>The moon was high in the night as full as it could possibly be.  It lit up the small clearing we stayed in.  And the fire was only needed for warmth -- and to keep the vermin at bay I supposed.  I definitely didn't want to see it die in the night.</p>
<p>I shifted Austin awake for his turn, and Kis too.  Rhesus was sleeping sitting up and I wasn't in the mood to deal with him so I left him so I could sleep for real -- it wasn't my bed at home, and it wasn't a shared space with Nyx.  And it was only the second night I'd really spent away from him that I could remember.  He was always there waiting for me.  And I missed his warmth and presence of mind.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> does anything happen on second watch?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [8]+0 = 8)<br>
<strong>No, but</strong> Banter, Accident, Admission</p>
<hr>
<p>My dreams were filled with sexy times with Nyx.  Things we'd never done, things I honestly never really dreamed about until now.  He was always my friend, always like a brother. I had feelings of course.  But never thought about his towards me, how much we had changed in the past few years.</p>
<p>Why hadn't I seen that he had been growing and showing me he wasn't a burden.  Why didn't he just tell me?</p>
<p>Between the naughty bits there was romance.  Our friendship was built on it in a weird way.  Always friends, always together.  My dreams reminded me that there had always been more.  And I had fucked it up with a shitty reaction to his escaping powers.  Except it wasn't really -- was it?  He wanted to prove himself.  I'd let him.  He needed it.  I didn't.</p>
<p>The sun peaked it's head and I groaned through the thickness of a restless sleep.  My back ached and my knees were stiff.  I think I needed a good walk.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe we should walk a little today.&quot;  I said stretching my body like I was about to get in the sparring ring.  I ached all over.</p>
<p>Austin agreed. &quot;That sounds like a plan.  Which way we heading.&quot;</p>
<p>I glanced at the map and notice a lightly drawn X over top of the tower.  Nyx warning me from it I supposed.  &quot;Eastward I guess.  Though we might see a tower, Nyx says we shouldn't go there.  Or at least that's what I'm assuming the light X means.&quot;</p>
<p>I glanced at the three words still in the margins and grinned.  I couldn't wait to see him again.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Day 4</strong> - The 16th of Verdantwisp of the year 70AEE. It is Auraday.<br>
<strong>Weather:</strong>(1d20: [14] = 14)<br>
Warm<br>
<strong>Moon:</strong> 16 -&gt; just past the full moon<br>
<strong>Terrain:</strong> Forest<br>
(1d100: [66] = 66)<br>
Nothing Special, continuing terrain<br>
Developer: <strong>And...</strong><br>
Cover, Carry, Rusty<br>
(1d20: [4] = 4)</p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Is there morning interrupted with anything</em><br>
(1d20+0: [15]+0 = 15)<br>
<strong>Yes</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Is it in the forest?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [15]+0 = 15)<br>
<strong>Yes</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Is there a creature?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [8]+0 = 8)<br>
<strong>No, but</strong> Break, Web, Wary<br>
<strong>GM Intrusion</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>The rain and clouds had disappeared and our morning was bright and sunny.  I was grateful for no rain.  I was much happier drier than wet.  Soggy clothes sucked.</p>
<p>We headed in the direction Nyx had traveled.  The forest got eeriley quiet as I led the party through the seemingly never ending wood.  The trees grew closer together, the sun didn't peak through the canopy and there were no animal sounds in the trees.</p>
<p>&quot;Somethings around here.&quot;  I said quietly.</p>
<p>Kis sniffed at the air and growled softly. &quot;Eight legs.&quot;</p>
<p>How the hell did he know how many legs were out there?  And then I saw the first web that stretched high in the limbs above.  &quot;Spiders.  And big ones from the looks of those webs.&quot;</p>
<p>Austin shushed us.  &quot;Quiet.  And be on the guard.&quot;</p>
<p>Rhesus edged his axe from the loop on his back and I freed a dagger on my belt.  Austin was knocking an arrow as we moved through the forest as quietly and as quickly as possible.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Do the spiders attack?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [4]+0 = 4)<br>
<strong>No</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>I felt my heart in my throat.  It was the only sound I heard other than the clip-clop of the horses hooves on the ground.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure when the sounds of the forest returned, and the trees started to lessen as we looked out on to the plains.  A tower in the distance was visible.  &quot;We need to avoid that too.&quot;  I said.  No telling what was there.  And I wasn't in the mood to go near a fucking tower my more than brave friend said to stay away from.</p>
<p>So that was what we did.  We went around the tower in a wide berth, always keeping it in view but never going close enough to it.  We didn't want any trouble. I just wanted to get this fucking staff and get the fuck back to Nyx.</p>
