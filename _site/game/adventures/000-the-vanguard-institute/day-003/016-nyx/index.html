<hr>
<p>The plains were empty for as far as the eye could see.  Stopping might as well be anytime.  I found a flat spot and cleared the grass from the area so not to start a fire.  Though that was always a possiblity with me around.</p>
<p>We settled into the middle of nowhere in the middle of the plains under the starry sky to rest.  I sat by the fire and sketched the tower I'd seen earlier and noticed the note in the margin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love you.  I'm sorry.  Come back.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I bit my bottom lip and my heart beat faster.   I erased the note and scribbled my own note.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You do?  I need to do this.  Trust me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a slight delay before the message disappeared and Sasha returned a response.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do.  You will come back to me?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn't have to think about it.  I was erasing and scribbling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Always.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I paused a few moments and scribbled a few more words on the map in the margin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I curled up staring at the map.  Seralina sang softly in her urn.  She was enjoying the adventure.  Tomorrow would be better.</p>

<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Does Nyx dream?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [19]+0 = 19)<br>
<strong>Yes, and</strong> Portal, Duty, Performance<br>
<strong>GM Intrusion</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>I drifted off to sleep and woke to the fire and chanting.  A screaming child in the distant and the soft cry of a mother nearby.  The chant was in a strange language, one that the dreamer didn't understand, but for some reason I could.</p>
<p>The crowd chanted &quot;Ardere.  Great Phoenix.&quot;</p>
<p>While the man dressed in fiery feathers and a beaked hood spoke from a book.  &quot;I summon thee Our God.  Our savior.  Come burn the heretics.  Come with the offering.&quot;</p>
<p>A baby, not barely a few months old was held above the man's head.  The child's skin ran with blood with lines that looked like feathers.</p>
<p>My eyes shot open and I sat up in my bedroll.  I pulled my sleeves of the dark cloth from my skin and saw the lines that ran with blood.  I stared at the lines in horrifying memory.  But there was no time to reflect upon that as a howl nearby pulled my attention to the edge of the fire light.  And the next second, barely any time to react an demon with wings carrying a skull dashed into our little clearing and through the fire.  A wolf cashed through after it.</p>
<p>The wolf was jet black with glowing red eyes.</p>

<hr>
<p>Seralina watched the shadowy wolf circle us as I pulled my power out and waved my hands in front of it. &quot;Go away!&quot;</p>
<p>It cringed at my movement but stalked around us.  The demon creature staying behind me crashing through the fire a second time.  &quot;Be careful.  We don't want to start a fire.&quot;</p>
<p>A voice boomed from seemingly nowhere. &quot;Yes we do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No we don't.&quot;  I said. I pulled upon the power and a ball of fire formed in my hands, the creature stared at me and then slinked back into the shadows.  It bayed into the darkness and was gone -- or so we hoped.</p>
<p>That could have gone badly.</p>
<p>I sighed as I sank to the ground and let the flames depart.</p>
<p>&quot;Handy trick.&quot;  The voice again boomed.</p>
<p>&quot;Where are you?  Stop hiding.&quot; I said softly.</p>
<p>&quot;Not hiding.&quot;  The winded demon said.  It patted the skull.  &quot;Cimmeris, here.&quot;  It tapped its chest.  &quot;Xit.&quot;  Then pointed at me &quot;You?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nyx.&quot;  I pointed to Seralina. &quot;This is Seralina.  What are you running from?&quot;</p>
<p>The skull chuckled.  Or the voice did rather, the skulls only indication it was otherworldly was the shadowy fog that swirled in the eye sockets.  &quot;Our master sends his pets after us.  He wants me back. And I refuse to go. Xit sat me down by the fire.&quot;</p>
<p>The small creature set the skull down and then it curled up next to it.  &quot;You have a horse.  Take us with you.  Once I'm freed I can offer a reward, but trapped in this infernal thing I'm nothing but a tool.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How are you going to get free?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Damned if I know.  The Umbral equinox maybe?  Might be thin enough to go home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When's that?&quot; I asked.  This wasn't precisely my understanding.  Though I knew a little.</p>
<p>&quot;Ten months or more I gauge by the feel of the Shadow Plane, tis very close but on the far side.&quot; Cimmeris said with sadness.  &quot;A long wait indeed.  Plenty of time to repay you for your services here.  What do you seek Nyx?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm on a mission.&quot;  I said. &quot;I suppose I could use help.  But how is a skull supposed to help me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am a powerful Shade Elemental, I retain some of my powers.  And Xit can help. He is loyal to me.  Easily persuaded though, so we will need to keep him happy too. I was lucky Darreh Cazendi is a horrible master.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How do we keep him happy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Treat him well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't have much food.  We are going to have to stop.&quot;  I said.  &quot;What do you all eat?&quot;</p>
<p>We discussed food and travel arrangements and other things before I drifted back to sleep.</p>
