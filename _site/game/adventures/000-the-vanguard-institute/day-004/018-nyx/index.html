<hr>
<p>The might was fitful, the dreams were the same.  I was a sacrifice to Ardere, the Great Phoenix.  The same Phoenix that I'd been in the vision in the fire. The glowing lines on my body were cut into my skin, healed by the power of the phoenix and what gave me my power.  That was what the dreams told me.  But were they real?</p>
<p>Or were they just figments of my imagination.</p>
<p>I knew of only one place that could help -- The Church of the Phoenix.  Saleh had forbidden me from talking to the cult in Oceana.  But after this initiation I could do what I wanted.  I would speak to the high priestess there in town when we got back.</p>
<p>But for now I had to find that staff and venture forth into the world alone, well with my new found friends.  Kinda anyway.  I missed Sasha.  I wished I hadn't left.  But I couldn't back down now, no matter how much I wanted to.  I just wanted to be with Sasha.  He wanted to be with me.</p>
<p>I glanced at the note left in the margins and wondered what he was doing as he rode through the forest.  What would they see that I didn't in the dark.</p>
<p>My day was uneventful.  Seralina and Cimmeris chatted in their respective vessels while Xit flit around us on his wings, sometimes perching on Thunderbolt's head or rump to rest.  It was oddly quiet through our journey, much more enjoyable now.</p>
<p>We stopped for a midday meal, and then started again.  Nothing happened on the plains it seemed.  They were boring and flat and not even a tree in sight.</p>
<p>The village ahead came into view at least an hour before we reached it.  The closer we drew to the village, the darker the sky felt, and not just because the sun was setting.  There was a heavy weight upon the village.  Everything felt suffocating to me.</p>
<p>Even my other companions felt it, at least their chatter stopped and Seralina hid in her urn away from prying eyes as we stepped onto the dirt road that lead north away from the village, but we went past the nearly abandoned farms into the village proper.  Xit hid in my saddle bags.  My friends left me to fend for myself it seemed.  Thunderbolt danced nervously as we trod through the street.  The lake beyond the village was black.  I imagined it was just as dark in the daylight as it was in the fading sun.</p>

<p>I wasn't halfway to the tower before a guard was on me, sword drawn with the smell of foul swill ale emanating from their breath as they spoke.  &quot;Halt.  Who goes there?&quot; Followed by a snicker at the cliché words spoken.</p>
<p>I dismounted Thunderbolt and he danced as I calmed him before approaching the dwarven woman who bore the crest of the Vanguard on her chest, but the black gem in her left ear spoke of the Obsidian Syndicate. I wasn't sure exactly what it meant, but Sasha carried an uncut stone around his neck like it.  Sasha thought I hadn't been paying attention to things.  That I didn't know he was to be initiated into their ranks.  I didn't care much, but Trevan liked to talk about Sasha when he thought I wasn't in ear shot.</p>
<p>The dwarf looked up at me with her dull green eyes and gave me a stout smile. &quot;I remember you.  You're friends with Sasha -- that little shape shifter!&quot;  She clapped me on the small of my back. &quot;He ain't with ye?&quot; She asked looking around for any of my companions.</p>
<p>I shook my head. &quot;I'm scouting ahead.&quot; I lied.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Deceive the dwarf (9)</em><br>
(1d20: [11] = 11)<br>
<strong>Success</strong><br>
Developer: None<br>
(1d20: [3] = 3)</p>
<hr>
<p>She nodded as though that was something that might happen.  It wasn't exactly a lie, but I wasn't planning on waiting around for Sasha either.</p>
<p>&quot;Is there any place in town I can buy some food for the road?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, sure.  The Tipsy Ants is the only place to stay and find food for travelers.&quot;  She laughed. &quot;I'm heading there now.  Let me take you.&quot;  She grabbed Thunderbolts reins and he jerked out of her hand and nuzzled my elbow.</p>
<p>&quot;Feisty one.&quot;  She laughed.</p>
<p>I took his reins back in my hands and followed next to the dwarven woman.  &quot;I'm Nyx by the way.&quot;</p>
<p>She looked up at me with a frown.  &quot;I knew I knew your name.  Daldroni Steelforged, but most people call me Roni.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A pleasure.&quot; I said.</p>
<p>Roni lead me to the Tipsy Ant.  Darkwell wasn't that big.  It was smaller than Oceana, but Oceana didn't have as many residents as this small village.  It was a school after all.  And this was not.  The Vanguard Institute took care of the instructors and villagers who lived there, it was rich in comparison.</p>
<p>The door swung open and the smell of swill ale and body odor poured out.  I nearly gagged as I tied Thunderbolt to the post and waited for the stable boy to begin tending to the horse.  I took my saddle bags which included the urn and skull trinkets of my companions and the little imp sat on my shoulder.</p>
<p>Roni stared at the small leathery creature.  &quot;What be that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's Xit.  He's a friend, and he won't bother anyone.&quot;</p>
<p>And the moment I stepped into the raucous scene it quieted and all eyes turned to the glowing stranger with an imp on his shoulder.  But Xit was the least of my concerns.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Does anyone do anything when Nyx walks in?</em><br>
(1d20+0: [2]+0 = 2)<br>
<strong>No, and</strong> Twisted, Cover, Pattern</p>
<hr>
<p>Glares and stares were the only greeting, but the room didn't return to the noise level it had.  Whispers filled the room.  &quot;Look at the stranger.&quot;  &quot;What's that on his shoulder?&quot; &quot;He's fucking on fire.&quot;</p>
<p>I ignored what I could of the hushed whispers and approached the bar. &quot;I need a room, a meal and some travel rations if you have any for tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>The man at the bar grumped at me then nodded as he headed into the kitchen for a moment and returned with a bowl of gruel.  It looked cold and congealed and worse than what I had left of my travel rations.  This was going to be a long night.</p>
<p>&quot;Three pence for the food. An eagle for the room.  Rations I can sell ya tomorrow.&quot; He said.</p>
<p>I handed over the coin and he handed me a key with a wooden toggle with room number burnt into it.  Xit clicked in my ear and the others were eager to be free of their confines so I made my way up to our room.  I didn't want to linger long.  Everyone stared at me.  I would have to be extra cautious over the night.  Last thing I needed was to be accosted in my sleep.</p>
<p>Though short of staying awake I wasn't sure how best to handle that situation.  But for now food and seeing the accommodations.  I didn't expect much.</p>
