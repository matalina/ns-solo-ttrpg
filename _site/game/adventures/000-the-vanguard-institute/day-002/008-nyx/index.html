<p>Sasha made breakfast from a portion of our rations.  It was not his usual fare but you made do with what you had.  It was hot and filling and that was all that mattered.</p>
<p>We packed up camp and put out the fire.  And we were on the road before the rain started to fall.  We were all wet at miserable as we trudged through the forest in the direction of this swamp we were supposed to obtain an object.  A thing we had no idea what it was.</p>
<p>Rhesus bitched about Kis.  Kis just sat and listened.  He rarely said anything in return.  Sasha rode by my side, but he didn't do more than glance at me from his saddle.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;You are mad at me.&quot; Sasha whispered.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not mad at you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well you are something at me.  I know you better than you think I do.&quot;</p>
<p>I laughed. &quot;I know that.  I don't underestimate you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I underestimate you?  Is that what you are saying?&quot;</p>
<p>I shook my head with a frown.  &quot;No. But you think you'll leave me so I'm doing something wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha growled and pushed Aurora faster to lead the way for now.  We were traveling west.  That's all that mattered for the moment.  West through a forest thick with trees.</p>
<p>I don't know what I was doing wrong but Sasha was upset with me more than usual.  I didn't worry about it as I tried to gauge where we were on the map.  It's not like it was to scale or anything.  Just notes on a map really.  Nothing like measurements or anything.</p>
<p>Sasha was several lengths ahead of us and he slowed and then stopped.  He held up his hand for quiet and for us to stop as he slipped off Aurora and tied the horse to the nearest tree with a simple loop she could pull out of if danger entreated her.</p>
<p>Sasha slipped into the shadows.</p>

<p>We all slide from our horses and prepared for a fight.  I pulled on the power of the Phoenix and sheathed myself in flames.</p>
<p>Austin chuckled even as he knocked an arrow.  &quot;That is so cool.&quot;</p>
<p>Rhesus scoffed as he drew his axe and shield from his back and raged towards the goblins.  Kis took the horses and lopped off to safety.</p>
<p>Sasha made his way closer and as he knelt in the bushes, he stepped on a root that rustled the bushes nearby and there was a shout, &quot;Intruders!&quot;.  Several figures ambled through the bushes towards Sasha.</p>

<hr>
<p>Six goblins rushed towards Sasha I unleashed a fire from my hands and it shot towards the first goblin and it collapsed to the ground writhing in pain and screaming horribly.  The smell of burning hair and flesh permeated the air.</p>
<p>Three smaller goblins and a much larger one reached Sasha at the same time and he managed to dodge out of both of their stabbing daggers in their stubby green hands.</p>
<p>Austin's knocked arrow flew straight and true and landed in the bigger goblin's shoulder.  He howled in pain as Rhesus finished their Leader off.  They looked a little demorialized and even more so as Sasha's blade ripped through another goblin.</p>
<p>I hurled another fireball at the nearest goblin to Sasha and it fell too.  The goblins turned to run away.  Austin pegged one in the back of the head and it fell to the ground in a heap as it ran away.  Rhesus pursued the last fleeing goblin before wandering off into the woods to collect himself.  He bashed his shield against a tree several times before he returned to us panting, but sane.  Blood rage was hard to break.</p>
<p>I wondered if that was the reason he'd been sent to join the Vanguard Institute -- put his talents to good use.</p>
<p>Sasha didn't hesitate as he rummaged through all the bodies.  Rhesus followed behind Sasha taking all the daggers.</p>
<p>I quelched the fire on my skin and headed towards the farm house. Sasha grabbed my elbow and stopped me. &quot;Don't go alone. Something doesn't feel right about this place.&quot;  He handed me several items he picked up from the goblins.  He handed what looked like a throwable container of noxious something to Austin.  &quot;Figure you can use this from the distance.  Just don't hit us up close guys.&quot;</p>
<p>Sasha pocketed the rest and joined me as we headed towards the farmhouse.</p>
<p>It looked abandoned, but why had goblins been attacking it?  Maybe I should have left the shroud of flames up?</p>
