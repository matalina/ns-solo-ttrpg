      <h1>Phoenix Bound</h1>
<h2>Bears the Phoenix Feather</h2>
<p>Requires: Bound Magic Creature as an origin ability, 3 disadvantages and added Tier Advancement Requirement.</p>
<p>Tier 1: Shroud of Flame<br/>
Tier 2: Hurl Flame<br/>
Tier 3: Font of Healing  or Wings of Fire<br/>

<h3>Tier Advancement Addition:</h3>
<p>In order to advance to the next tier the Bearer must spend an additional 4XP to level the Phoenix</p>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>If the Young Phoenix is reduced to 0 health, it dissipates. It reforms in its object in 2d6 + 2 days and you are debilitated for the same numbers of days. If you are debilitated in this manner all your pools must be reduced to zero to die.</li>
<li>Choose 2:
<ul>
<li>People find you unnerving. All tasks relating to pleasant social interaction are hindered. (Glowing object when inside, or glowing phoenix outside)</li>
<li>When the Young Phoenix is neither mentally connected or in close proximity, all Intellect and Speed tasks are hindered. (you rely on the phoenix)</li>
<li>You tend to fixate on the details, making you somewhat oblivious to whatâ€™s going on around you. Any task to hear or notice dangers around you is hindered. (the phoenix wants to know everything, do everything)</li>
<li>When you see something interesting, you hesitate as you take in all the details. Initiative actions (to determine who goes first in combat) are hindered. (the phoenix wants to know everything, do everything)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Protects the Feather Bearer</h2>
<p>The focus of the Phoenix bound by the Feather.</p>
<p>Tier 1: Healing Touch for the Bearer<br/>
Tier 2: Devoted Defender of the Bearer<br/>
Tier 3: Hidden Closet<br/>
Tier 4: Inspire Action of the Bearer<br/>
Tier 5: Willing Sacrifice for the Bearer<br/>
Tier 6: Greater Healing Touch for the Bearer or Restore Life of the Bearer<br/></p>
<h3>Other Tier Advancements for the Phoenix</h3>
<ul>
<li>+1 fire damage</li>
<li>New Tier Ability</li>
<li>New Tier Health + 2</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interactions</h3>
<p>The Phoenix doesn't always do as he's asked.  The following table helps determine the reaction of the Phoenix based upon the relationship between it and the bearer.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>d20 + [RS]</th>
<th>Reaction</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1-6</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7-12</td>
<td>Maybe</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>13+</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>where RS = the Relationship score with the bearer.  A platonic score is positive and a rivalry score is negative.  Cannot be both platonic and a rival.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
